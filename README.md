This project compares the performance of several machine learning models on the **'Dry Bean'** dataset from UCI. The following classification algorithms have been used: 
1. Multinomial Logistic Regression
2. Decision Trees
3. Random Forest
4. XGBoost
5. SVM _(Support Vector Machine)_
6. Neural Network
7. k-NN _(k-Nearest Neighbours)_
8. Naive Bayes.
